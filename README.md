# Samsung M31 (SM-M315F) - Device Kernel Source

Kernel source code of Samsung Galaxy M31 (SM-M315F) for my personal study.

[![Android kernel build test](https://github.com/SaicharanKandukuri/samsung-m31-kernel/actions/workflows/build-kernel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SaicharanKandukuri/samsung-m31-kernel/actions/workflows/build-kernel.yml)

- Build utilities are specially created for **linux amd64** hosts. [build.sh](build.sh)
- less headache with **aarch64** toolchain. [**resolv_toolchain_linux.sh**](resolv_toolchain_linux.sh)

> **Note:** This is not an official Samsung repository.

============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
